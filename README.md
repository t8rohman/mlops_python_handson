Hands-on practices on how to deploy ml model into operationalization. This exercise demonstrates some practical hands-on in the machine learning model deployment world. All of the exercises are taken <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/product/machine-learning-engineering-with-python-second-edition/9781837631964">from Machine Learning Engineering with Python written by Andrew P. McMahon</a>. 

Below are the contents of the exercise:

1. Packaging Python Program (01_packaging)
   - Wrap the outlier scanning model to a package.
   - Using the <b>setup.py</b> and <b>requirements.txt</b> to package the code.
   - <b>Makefile</b> introduction to automate software building procedure and other complex tasks with dependencies.

2. Quick Tensorflow Deployment End-to-End
   - Build the neural network model on the popular <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data">Titanic dataset</a> using <b>tensorflow</b>.
   - <b>Model versioning</b> using .cfg file.
   - Quick deployment using <b>Flask for getting the prediction</b>.
